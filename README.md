# CODING-SAMURAI-INTERNSHIP-TASK

I created two projects during my internship at Coding Samurai in the Web Development domain. The first is a personal portfolio, for which I used HTML and CSS exclusively. The second project is a TO-DO List, where a user can add tasks they need to complete, mark them as completed, and change the search results based on completed and incompleted tasks. For this project I used HTML, CSS and JS.
